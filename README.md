# GSM System
A first year university project simulating the transmission of PDU-encoded messages from a sender through a series of network layers to the recipients.

The transmission of an example SMS message looks as follows: 

    VBD → BTS → BSC → ··· → BTS → VRD

where
- VBD - virtual sending device 
- BTS - base station 
- BSC - controller station 
- VRD - virtual receiving device
